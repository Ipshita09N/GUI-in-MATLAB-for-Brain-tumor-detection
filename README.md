# GUI-in-MATLAB-for-Brain-tumor-detection
This is a project based on MATLAB where I created a GUI for detecting brain tumor in MRI images of a patient. I used Image processing, and computer vision toolbox of MATLAB to create a GUI which detects brain tumor using several process like pre-processing, edge detection, segmentation, and morphological operations.
